# LeapMind

Neural net implementation in C++ from scratch. Trained MNIST with 3 layer network. Added weight regularization.

Could have implemented Dropout and Batch Norm, but would have taken more days.

Developed on Ubuntu 16.04 using g++ 5.4 `g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609`

### Important Files

* `mnist.h`: Main file with all the code
* `main.cpp`: Calls the `mnist()` function in `mnist.h`, that's all
* `data`: Directory where MNIST files are kept
* `data\dl.sh`: Bash script to download and unzip the MNIST files
* `output.txt`: Execution log of a full run with 5 episodes 

### Download data

```
cd data
./dl.sh
cd ..
```

### Build and Run

Edit configurations in mnist.h (epochs, batch size etc.). Then,

```
make
./mnist
```

```

`still reachable: 72,704 bytes in 1 blocks` is a known bug in gcc. Othersise all parameters are okay and suggests no leak.
